Bits of useful code that I write

* `array_view`, a simple 1-D array view class. Requires C++14 constexpr support.
* `simple_rand`, a replacement for `rand()` using the C++11 random number library.
* An implementation of the `byte` type proposed in [P0298](http://wg21.link/P0298). Requires C++1z.
* An implementation of `to_chars` and `from_chars` (for integral values) from [P0682R1](http://wg21.link/P0682R1)
* An implementation of `scope_guard` from [P0052R5](https://wg21.link/P0052)
